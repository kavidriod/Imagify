# Imagify

Imagify is a photo editing application that allows users to apply filters to a hardcoded image to enhance it. 
This app utilizes Kotlin Coroutines to perform asynchronous tasks efficiently, including executing multiple tasks in parallel and handling exceptions gracefully.

  **Android Concepts Used:**

* Coroutine Scope: Defines the context in which coroutines are executed.
* Coroutine Builder: Provides a way to create and start coroutines.
* Coroutine Dispatcher: Specifies the thread or threads on which a coroutine runs.
* Exception Handling: Utilizes try-catch blocks and CoroutineExceptionHandler to handle exceptions gracefully.
